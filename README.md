# NFA-to-DFA-Conversion

This Python program efficiently converts a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and visualizes both automata as mathematical graphs. This conversion process ensures that the DFA recognizes the same language as the original NFA while eliminating non-determinism.
